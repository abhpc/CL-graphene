# CL-graphene
Line cut method to estimate the average grain size of nanocrystalline graphene (nc-Gr).

[Ovito 3.0.0-dev422](https://www.ovito.org/) is used for the microstructure analysis of nc-Gr, and we have added it into our environment modules. Thus, we can use it by the command below:
```
$ module load ovito/3.0.0dev
```
